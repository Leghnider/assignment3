		<h2> The Cellphone </h2>
			<p> The cellphone was exclusively used by top officialsin WWII in order to communicate secret information to one another as quickly as possible. The idea was that if civillians got their hands on these devices, important information could be compromised, hence why mobile phones didn't become available to the public until 1973. 
			
			
			Today cellphone activity can be entirely untraceable, posing as an entirely new issue in terms of transferring dangerous information and facilitating organised crime </p>

  			<h3> The Flash Drive</h3>
		
				<p> Most of the modern devices we use today have some form of USB port in their external design. Before the USB came about, wired connection to other computers was necessary in order to transfer information from one device to the other. What you don't know is that USBs were initially designed to be digital keys, which were going to take over the old lock-and-key system. However, when it's storage properties were discovered, it was decided that a more effective use of these devices would be to make data portable. </p>

			<h4> The Micro Chip</h4>
				<p> Another form of information storage, this takes on an even smaller size compared to the USB. The way in which the SD card differs is that it was intially designed to be an internal digital storage of human memories. By inserting a small chip under the surface of the skin, the idea was it will register all memories formed and act as a life-long memory capsule. </p>

	<h5> The Go Pro </h5>
		<p> The portable, durable, waterproof camera has come to be a popular gadget for those who want to document their adventures into the depths of nature. What's interesting was that this device was intended to be used for personal safety at night. By attaching this camera to your body, you can keep a live trace of your steps in order to recall events if you're memory recall was impaired at the time. </p>
